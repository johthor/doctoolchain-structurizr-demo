The base project for this demonstration is the https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/[spring-petclinic-microservices] project which is one of the https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html[several forks] hosted in a special GitHub org: https://github.com/spring-petclinic[spring-petclinic].

This microservices branch was initially derived from https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular1[AngularJS version] to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[microservices].
